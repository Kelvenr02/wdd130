            <h2>History</h2>
            <p id="first-p">Rafting Momentum was founded in 2005 by a group of passionate adventurers who shared a love for the thrill of white water rafting. What began as a small operation with a single raft and a handful of local enthusiasts quickly grew into a full-fledged adventure company, known for its dedication to safety, customer satisfaction, and environmental stewardship. The founders, inspired by their own experiences navigating challenging rapids and exploring pristine waterways, set out to create a company that would offer others the same sense of excitement and connection with nature.</p>
