                <p>Hello, I'm Kelven Rodrigues from João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brazil. I served a full-time mission in the Brazil Piracicaba Mission, which changed my life with the message of The Gospel of Jesus Christ. Along the way, I got to improve my communication and leadership skills. I love playing video games and cycling, as well as coding and running. But family and friends always comes first to me. I'm studying Software Development at BYU Idaho with my sights set on a future as a web developer.</p>
